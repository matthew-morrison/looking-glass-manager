## What is this?

Looking Glass Manager is a GUI frontend to the looking-glass-client KVM application.

This is NOT the looking glass client by Geoffrey McRae. This also does NOT install that client.
This GUI simply interacts with an existing installation of that client.

## Why?

looking-glass-client is a commandline utility which takes in arguments in the standard linuxy way.
I personally found trying different settings to be very tedious for LG, and wanted a better solution.

Looking Glass Manager GUI is a way to easily change settings and restart the LG application.

I learned how to use the QT5 framework, use ini files for the first time, and how to control processes from the QT5 GUI and from Python scripts in general.
