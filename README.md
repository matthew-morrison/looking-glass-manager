## What is this?

Looking Glass Manager is a GUI frontend to the looking-glass-client KVM application.

## Why?

looking-glass-client is a commandline utility which takes in arguments in the standard linuxy way.
I found trying different settings to be very tedious for LG, and wanted a better solution.

Looking Glass Manager GUI is a way to easily change settings and restart the LG application.

I learned how to use the QT5 framework, use ini files for the first time, and how to control processes from the QT5 GUI and from Python scripts in general.
